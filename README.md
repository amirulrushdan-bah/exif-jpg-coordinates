# exif-jpg-coordinates
simple python script to display on google maps where the picture was taken.
It opens all the .jpg and do the google search for each picture. Be careful not to put too much
simply add JPG files in the same repository as the script. Make sure the extension type is .jpg (can be changed in the script)
